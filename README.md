# Sense Your Own Adventure
Seeing is not your only option. Discover more opportunities using Touch Typing.

## Submission
Submitted for HackUNT 2019

## Inspiration
There are not many fun digital opportunities for children who have visual disabilities. When we were children, we had a variety of games to train our muscle memory to use the keyboard without looking, which is called touch typing. We wanted to bring this experience to all children.

## What it does
Sense Your Own Adventure not only teaches blind children how to get used to the keyboard, but it also provides them with an auditory experience and lets their imaginations visualize their scenario.

## How we built it
We used ReactJS for building the frontend and housing the javascript logic for going through the story. The style sheets were made using Sass. We used MongoDB to hold the story nodes and convert that to a .JSON file to give our functions the data.

## Challenges we ran into
### Game design
Since this was the first game we created, it took us quite a while to draw out the concept map of our game logic.
### Getting the text-to-speech to work 
Internet browsers have started to depreciate the Text-To-Speech accessibility features to prevent people from misusing it. Implementing it in spite of the depreciation and limitations took some time and complex calculations.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Not only is this the game we created, but it is also the first application we’ve built with React.

## What we learned
We learned how to create a React App and created a game.

## What's next for Sense Your Own Adventure
We look forward to adding tutorials to actually learn the keys, not assume the user already knows and it’s just review, so if the user gets it wrong, the game can teach them where the key is. We would also want to add more stories and levels.
